# udisc_stats

## Introduction

* This project was made to provide more data visualization functionality with UDisc scorecards (CSV).
* Uses Streamlit to host a web app that the user can interact with.
* Unfortunately, UDisc does not provide a public API to access round scores. This means you will need to manually obtain your round scores in CSV format via the UDisc app and inject that into this app.
